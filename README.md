# Heatlthcare-Chatbot-using-AI
A Flask-powered web app that predicts diseases based on symptoms using a Random Forest model and cosine similarity.

**Flask-Based Disease Prediction and Health Information Application**  

This project is a Flask-powered web application designed to predict potential diseases based on user-reported symptoms and provide comprehensive health information. Leveraging a curated dataset of diseases and symptoms, it integrates machine learning techniques, including a pre-trained Random Forest model and cosine similarity, to generate personalized disease predictions.  

Key Features:  
- *User-Friendly Interface*: Allows users to register, log in, and input symptoms easily.  
- *Interactive Chatbot*: Guides users through the symptom input process for accurate data collection.  
- *Machine Learning Models*: Implements a Random Forest algorithm for robust disease classification.  
- *Health Insights*: Fetches detailed disease information using the DuckDuckGo API.  
- *Database Management*: Uses SQLAlchemy to securely manage user and symptom data.  
- *Additional Features*: Includes a BMI calculator for added health tracking.  
- *Deployment*: Designed for hosting on platforms like Heroku, AWS, or Google Cloud.
